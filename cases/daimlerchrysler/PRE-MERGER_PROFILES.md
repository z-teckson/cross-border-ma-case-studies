# Pre‑Merger Corporate Profiles: Daimler‑Benz vs. Chrysler

## Daimler‑Benz AG (Germany)

### Governance Structure
- **Two‑tier board system** mandated by German law:
  - **Supervisory Board (Aufsichtsrat)**: Composed of shareholder representatives (10) and employee representatives (10). Chaired by a non‑executive chairman (Hilmar Kopper). Responsible for appointing, supervising, and advising the Management Board.
  - **Management Board (Vorstand)**: Solely executive directors, headed by the CEO (Jürgen Schrempp). Legally responsible for day‑to‑day operations and strategic decisions.
- **Stakeholder‑oriented model**: German corporate law (Aktiengesetz) requires the management board to act in the “interest of the enterprise,” balancing shareholder, employee, creditor, and societal interests.
- **Strong employee co‑determination**: Works councils have substantial influence over operational decisions; employee representatives hold half of supervisory‑board seats.
- **Long‑term investment horizon**: Emphasis on engineering excellence, product quality, and brand reputation over quarterly earnings.

### Corporate Culture
- Hierarchical, formal, and consensus‑driven decision‑making.
- Engineering‑centric culture with deep respect for technical perfection.
- Conservative financial management; low tolerance for high leverage.
- Strong national identity (“Made in Germany”) and pride in industrial heritage.

## Chrysler Corporation (USA)

### Governance Structure
- **Unitary (single‑tier) board**: Board of Directors (≈15 members) includes both executive and independent non‑executive directors. No legal separation between supervision and management.
- **Shareholder‑primacy model**: Fiduciary duty to maximize shareholder value, as interpreted under Delaware corporate law.
- **No mandatory employee representation**: No works councils or employee seats on the board. Labor relations governed by collective‑bargaining agreements with the UAW.
- **High managerial autonomy**: CEO (Robert Eaton) and top executives enjoy considerable discretion, subject to board oversight and market pressure.
- **Performance‑based compensation**: Heavy use of stock options and bonuses tied to short‑term financial metrics (EPS, ROE).

### Corporate Culture
- Informal, decentralized, and entrepreneurial; “lean and mean” attitude.
- Focus on cost control, speed‑to‑market, and marketing agility.
- Strong emphasis on quarterly results and stock‑price performance.
- Historically innovative in design (e.g., minivan) and supply‑chain management (SCORE program).
