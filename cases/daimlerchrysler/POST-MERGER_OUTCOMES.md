# Post‑Merger Outcomes: DaimlerChrysler (1998‑2007)

## Timeline of Key Events

### 1998
- **May 7**: Merger announced as a “merger of equals.”
- **November 12**: Merger legally completed; new entity DaimlerChrysler AG begins trading.

### 1999
- First full year of combined operations.
- **Cultural friction** surfaces: German vs. American management styles clash over decision‑making speed, cost control, and design philosophy.
- **Synergy targets** appear elusive; purchasing savings slower than expected.

### 2000
- **Profit warnings** issued as Chrysler division faces rising competition and falling market share.
- **Executive turnover**: Several senior Chrysler executives depart, citing frustration with Stuttgart’s centralized control.
- **Share price** underperforms both automotive peers and broader market indices.

### 2001
- **Robert Eaton retires**; Jürgen Schrempp becomes sole Chairman of the Management Board.
- **Chrysler division reports a $1.9 billion operating loss**, triggering a major restructuring (“Chrysler Turnaround Plan”).
- **Supervisory board tensions**: Employee representatives (German side) oppose layoffs and plant closures in the U.S.

### 2002‑2004
- **Repeated restructuring charges** erode consolidated earnings.
- **Failed integration of Mercedes‑Benz and Chrysler platforms**: Attempts to share components (e.g., the “Mercedes‑ized” Chrysler Crossfire) yield limited cost savings and brand‑dilution concerns.
- **Governance compromises**:
  - German‑style two‑tier board retained, but with American executives on the Management Board.
  - Compensation schemes become a point of contention: German managers resist U.S.‑style stock‑option packages.

### 2005
- **Schrempp admits** in a Financial Times interview that the “merger of equals” was never intended; he had always planned to make Chrysler a division of Daimler.
- **Shareholder activism**: Major U.S. institutional investors (e.g., Kirk Kerkorian) file lawsuits alleging misleading statements during the merger.
- **Chrysler’s market share** continues to decline amid rising fuel prices and intense competition from Asian manufacturers.

### 2006
- **Supervisory board votes** to explore “strategic options” for Chrysler, effectively putting it up for sale.
- **Dieter Zetsche** (former head of Chrysler turnaround) becomes CEO of DaimlerChrysler, replacing Schrempp.

### 2007
- **May 14**: DaimlerChrysler AG announces agreement to sell 80.1% of Chrysler to Cerberus Capital Management for $7.4 billion.
- **August 3**: Transaction closes; Chrysler becomes a privately held company again.
- **DaimlerChrysler AG renamed Daimler AG**, marking the formal end of the merger experiment.
